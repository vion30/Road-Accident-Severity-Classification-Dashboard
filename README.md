# Road Accident Severity Classification Dashboard

## Overview

This project includes a Jupyter Notebook, python file and dataset aimed at classifying the severity of road accidents. Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project demonstrates how to build a classification model that can predict the severity level of road accidents based on various factors. A dashboard is also developed to visualize the results, providing insights into accident patterns and severity distribution.
## Key Features

* Data preprocessing and analysis of accident data.
* Feature engineering for optimal model performance.
* Building and training a classification model to predict accident severity.
* Evaluation of model performance with accuracy metrics.
* Development of an interactive dashboard to visualize accident severity classifications and insights.
## Technology Used

* Python: Core programming language used for data manipulation and model development.
* Jupyter Notebook: Environment for code development and visualization.
* Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building and evaluating the classification model.
* Plotly/Dash: Libraries for creating an interactive dashboard and visualizing data insights.
## Notebooks

* Road_Accident_Severity_Classification_Dashboard.ipynb: The main notebook that contains the data analysis, model training, and dashboard code.
* accident.csv: The dataset used in this project, containing information on road accidents and related variables.
* pipeline.py containing pipeline steps.
